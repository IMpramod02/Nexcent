        it includes essential elements like contact information, social media
        links, and quick navigation links. Use a consistent color scheme and
        typography that aligns with your site’s overall design. Incorporate a
        clean layout with clear sections to enhance readability. Finally, make
        sure it’s responsive so it looks great on all devices. Additionally,
